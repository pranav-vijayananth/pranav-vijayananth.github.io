Hey! I'm Pranav a undergrad student @ Purdue University studying CS + DS. I am really passionate about TUI's, open-source projects, and machine learning (really interested about self-organizing maps and graph machine learning models). In my freetime, you can catch  me lifting or listening to music. I also enjoy travelling and going on road trips with my family.
